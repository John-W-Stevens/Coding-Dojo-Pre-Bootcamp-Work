Introduction to Web Development - Airplane Game

This is my work for one of Coding Dojo's pre-bootcamp assignments.

airplane.html - basic game with simple collision detection and score

spacefighter.html - same as airplane.html with the following additions:
    a. Game is set in outer space (different background and player/enemy skins)
    b. Pressing 'p' pauses/unpauses the game
    c. Enemies spawn with random (and differing) speeds
    d. Pressing 'r' launches a rocket
    e. Lasers upgrade when the player reaches a certain score
    f. A keyup feature (allows the player to execute mutliple actions at once,
       like firing lasers and moving at the same time).

The PNGs and images are all readily available from the internet.
